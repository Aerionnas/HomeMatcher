Project Title: Home Matcher

Description: This program gives the user options for home based on their specifications.
I created this project for my COSI 11a class.

https://github.com/Aerionnas/HomeMatcher

Languages used: Java (Using Scanner to Read Files)

For this project, I used three different files: HomeMatcher.java, RE.csv, and
TextIO.java. Please find information about each file below:

HomeMatcher.java- This file contains the code and methods needed to read the RE.csv
file and it stores the information in several arrays. It also contains the main
method needed to run the program.

fortunes.csv- this file contains a list of homes and information associated with
that home separated by commas.

TextIO.java- this is just used to get the user input at certain points of the program.

Building this project, I face many challenges. One of the main challenges was
getting the scanner to read the csv file. I took several tries and stack overflow
to figure it out.

To run this project, compile the HomeMatcher class and run it in the
terminal.
